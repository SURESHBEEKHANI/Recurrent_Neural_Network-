# -Implementation-of-RNNs-and-LSTM
RNNs and LSTMs are both used for sequential data. RNNs are trained with backpropagation through time but can face issues with vanishing gradients. LSTMs, with their gated architecture, are designed to address these issues and handle long-term dependencies effectively.
